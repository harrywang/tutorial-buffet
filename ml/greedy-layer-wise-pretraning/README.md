## About

This is my revised code of the tutorial at https://machinelearningmastery.com/greedy-layer-wise-pretraining-tutorial/

## Setup

within the tutorial folder:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you can use `jupyter notebook` or use VSCode `code .` to open the notebooks.
