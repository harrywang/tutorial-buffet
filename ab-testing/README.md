## Document Clustering with Python 3

This is my revised code of the tutorial at https://towardsdatascience.com/the-math-behind-a-b-testing-with-example-code-part-1-of-2-7be752e1d06f.

## Setup

do the following at the root of this project:

```
cd ab-testing
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you can use `jupyter notebook` or use VSCode `code .` to open the notebooks.
