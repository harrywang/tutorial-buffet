## About

This is my revised code of the tutorial at: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-class-imbalanced-classification/

## Setup


```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you can use `jupyter notebook` or use VSCode `code .` to open the notebooks.
