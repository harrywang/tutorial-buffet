I combined and revised the following tutorials:
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-does-attention-work-in-encoder-decoder-recurrent-neural-networks/
- https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-ml-attention-with-keras-dc8dbc1fad39

## Setup

within the tutorial folder:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you can use `jupyter notebook` or use VSCode `code .` to open the notebooks.
