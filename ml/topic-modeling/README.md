## About

My revised code for

https://github.com/susanli2016/NLP-with-Python/blob/master/LDA_news_headlines.ipynb
https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modeling-and-latent-dirichlet-allocation-in-python-9bf156893c24

and

LDA from Scratch
My revised tutorial based on https://www.depends-on-the-definition.com/lda-from-scratch/

I also found another similar tutorial at https://gist.github.com/umbertogriffo/5041b9e4ec6c3478cef99b8653530032

## Setup

within the tutorial folder:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you can use `jupyter notebook` or use VSCode `code .` to open the notebooks.
