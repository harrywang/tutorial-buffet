## DATA DRIVEN GROWTH WITH PYTHON

This is my revised code of the tutorial at https://towardsdatascience.com/data-driven-growth-with-python-part-1-know-your-metrics-812781e66a5b.

## Setup

do the following at the root of this project:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you can use `jupyter notebook` or use VSCode `code .` to open the notebooks.
