# About

A script to convert csv to multiple txt based on a label column

## Data

```
1	The pork tenderloin with mole sauce was perfect , and the side dishes added a lot of nice , fresh flavor.	5	POS
2	The food was definitely more "upscale" than traditional Mexican , so don't come here if you are looking for Qdoba style burritos and quesadillas.	4	NEG
3	Another small bonus was the hard-to-find Sol beer , which was great with a lime.	4	POS
4	Speaking of lime , the guacamole starter was as fresh as it gets (made tableside) and had a nice kick to it!.	5	NEU
```
